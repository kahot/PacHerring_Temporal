# PacHerring_Temporal Repository
This repository contains the analysis scripts and associated data for temporal analysis of Pacific herring populations from Alaska.

Large data analysis were performed at a cluster computer at UC Davis (Farm) and downstream analysis were mostly done in R. CVTK (temporal covariance analysis of allele frequencies) were done in Python and R. 

The large data necessary to run R scripts are available at the following repositories:

1. ORS Repository: https://osf.io/wrca4
2. ORS Repository: https://osf.io/3cmkr/

Unavailable files at any repositores are available upon request to kahot@hawaii.edu.
Additional related analysis scripts may be available at https://github.com/kahot/PacHerring/
